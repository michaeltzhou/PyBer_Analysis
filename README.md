# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this challenge was to combine the two given .csv files into a single dataframe for analysis.
## Results
The data seems to indicate that the average fare per ride in urban areas is lower than that of rural areas, although the number of total rides and drivers is greater in urban areas than in rural areas.
## Summary
As seen below, the total fares is greatest in urban areas, followed by suburban and then rural areas.

Possible recommendations include trying to direct more drivers towards suburban and rural areas, as they have a higher fare per ride average than urban areas. Another recommendation could be potentially trying to group more urban riders together, as this would take advantage of the more populous urban riders. A final recommendation would be to institute a premium charge during peak hours. This might work especially well in urban areas, taking advantage of the high volume of riders.
